# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
   so many new functions were required to complete the percent section of the match function. Though chatgpt could tell me them, I didn't know they existed to be asked for, so i spent most of my extra time in class before we would go over the percent section trying all different attempts using only simple functions.


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
by abstracting extraneous words from questions, I can search databases efficiently for movies and get the information i need with less hassle.
